# Specification Quality Checklist: OPML Export

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items pass on first validation pass. Key scope decisions locked in Assumptions:
- OPML import is explicitly out of scope
- Overwrite (not versioned filenames) is the chosen file conflict behaviour
- Downloads folder = platform standard user-accessible location, not app sandbox
- No sharing sheet required; save-to-Downloads is the only delivery mechanism

Ready for `/speckit.plan`.
